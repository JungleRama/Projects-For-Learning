            <p>Known as the "king of the jungle," lions do not actually live in jungles but in grasslands and plains. Male lions are distinguished by their mane, which is a unique characteristic among felines. These social cats live in groups called prides, typically consisting of a few males, related females, and cubs. They are apex predators and play a crucial role in the ecosystem by helping to control herbivore populations.</p>
